  <h1>Dōgen Zenji</h1>
  <p>
    Dōgen Zenji (1200–1253) was a Japanese Buddhist monk, philosopher, and poet who founded the Sōtō school of Zen in Japan. After studying in China, he returned with a strong emphasis on zazen (seated meditation) as the core of Zen practice. His most famous work, the <em>Shōbōgenzō</em>, offers profound insights into time, being, and enlightenment, blending rigorous philosophy with spiritual depth. Dōgen's teachings continue to influence Zen practitioners around the world today.
